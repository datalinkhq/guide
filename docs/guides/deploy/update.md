### Updating Tovy in your server
When you are using `git clone`, it clones the entire repository to your device. Hence, updating will be easier and usually takes one line to complete. As long as you do not modify the source code.

To do that, make sure you have cancelled the process for Tovy in `PM2` or anything else. Just make sure Tovy is not running in the background.

After that, run this command when you are in the directory where Tovy resides:
```
git pull
```

Once complete, deploy your Tovy instance again, either with `PM2` or whatever.

ðŸŽ‰ You just updated Tovy to the latest version!
